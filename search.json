We need many people who have strengths in various aspects, such as Julia/Turing, theory, writing, making plots etc. Most importantly, this project can serve as a way for us to learn more about this approach to psychological science.\nIf you are interested in the project, you can let us know by opening an issue or getting in touch.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Installing Julia and Packages\nTODO.\n\n\n1.1.2 Julia Basics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Differences with Python and R\n\n\n\nThese are the most common sources of confusion and errors for newcomers to Julia:\n\n1-indexing: Similarly to R, Julia uses 1-based indexing, which means that the first element of a vector is x[1] (not x[0] as in Python).\nPositional; Keyword arguments: Julia functions makes a clear distinction between positional and keyword arguments, and both are often separated by ;. Positional arguments are typically passed without a name, while keyword arguments must be named (e.g., scatter(0, 0; color=:red)). Some functions might look like somefunction(; arg1=val1, arg2=val2).\nSymbols: Some arguments are prefixed with : (e.g., :red in scatter(0, 0; color=:red)). These symbols are like character strings that are not manipulable (there are more efficient).\nExplicit vectorization: Julia does not vectorize operations by default. You need to use a dot . in front of functions and operators to have it apply element by element. For example, sin.([0, 1, 2]) will apply the sin() function to each element of its vector.\nIn-place operations: Julia has a strong emphasis on performance, and in-place operations are often used to avoid unnecessary memory allocations. When functions modify their input “in-place” (without returns), a band ! is used. For example, assuming x = [0] (1-element vector containing 0), push!(x, 2) will modify x in place (it is equivalent to x = push(x, 2)).\nMacros: Some functions start with @. These are called macros and are used to manipulate the code before it is run. For example, @time will measure the time it takes to run the code that follows.\nUnicode: Julia is a modern language to supports unicode characters, which are used a lot for mathematical operations. You can get the mu μ character by typing \\mu and pressing TAB.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Generate Data from Normal Distribution\n\nusing Turing, Distributions, Random\nusing Makie\n\n# Random sample from a Normal(μ=100, σ=15)\niq = rand(Normal(100, 15), 500)\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = Figure()\nax = Axis(fig[1, 1], title=\"Distribution\")\ndensity!(ax, iq)\nfig\n\n\n┌ Warning: Found `resolution` in the theme when creating a `Scene`.

We will treat the data as if it was a single participant at first to better understand the parameters, but will show how to add random effects at the end.\n\n\nA linear model is the most common type of model. It aims at predicting the mean \\(\\mu\\) of the outcome variable using a Normal (aka Gaussian) distribution for the residuals. In other words, it models the outcome \\(y\\) as a Normal distribution with a mean \\(\\mu\\) that is itself the result of a linear function of the predictors \\(X\\) and a variance \\(\\sigma\\) that is constant across all values of the predictors. It can be written as \\(y = Normal(\\mu, \\sigma)\\), where \\(\\mu = intercept + slope * X\\).\nIn order to fit a Linear Model for RTs, we need to set a prior on all these parameters, namely: - The variance \\(\\sigma\\) (correspondong to the “spread” of RTs) - The mean \\(\\mu\\) for the intercept (i.e., at the reference condition which is in our case \"Speed\") - The effect of the condition (the slope).\n\n4.2.1 Model Specification\n\n@model function model_Gaussian(rt; condition=nothing)\n\n    # Set priors on variance, intercept and effect of condition\n    σ ~ truncated(Normal(0, 0.5); lower=0)\n\n    μ_intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 1); lower=0)\n    μ_condition ~ Normal(0, 0.3)\n\n    for i in 1:length(rt)\n        μ = μ_intercept + μ_condition * condition[i]\n        rt[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n    end\nend\n\n\nfit_Gaussian = model_Gaussian(df.RT; condition=df.Accuracy)\nchain_Gaussian = sample(fit_Gaussian, NUTS(), 400)\n\n\n# Summary (95% CI)\nhpd(chain_Gaussian; alpha=0.05)\n\n\nHPD\n   parameters     lower     upper \n       Symbol   Float64   Float64 \n            σ    0.1652    0.1701\n  μ_intercept    0.5071    0.5168\n  μ_condition    0.1319    0.1457\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of Condition is significant, people are on average slower (higher RT) when condition is \"Accuracy\".

    "text": "4.3 Scaled Gaussian Model\nThe previous model, despite its poor fit to the data, suggests that the mean RT is higher for the Accuracy condition. But it seems like the green distribution is also wider (i.e., the response time is more variable), which is not captured by the our model (the predicted distributions have the same widths). This is expected, as typical linear models estimate only one value for sigma \\(\\sigma\\) for the whole model, hence the requirement for homoscedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHomoscedasticity, or homogeneity of variances, is the assumption of similar variances accross different values of predictors. It is important in linear models as only one value for sigma \\(\\sigma\\) is estimated.\n\n\nIs it possible to set sigma \\(\\sigma\\) as a parameter that would depend on the condition, in the same way as mu \\(\\mu\\)? In Julia, this is very simple.\nAll we need is to set sigma \\(\\sigma\\) as the result of a linear function, such as \\(\\sigma = intercept + slope * condition\\). This means setting a prior on the intercept of sigma \\(\\sigma\\) (in our case, the variance in the reference condition) and a prior on how much this variance changes for the other condition. This change can, by definition, be positive or negative (i.e., the other condition can have either a biggger or a smaller variance), so the prior over the effect of condition should ideally allow for positive and negative values (e.g., σ_condition ~ Normal(0, 0.1)).\nBut this leads to an important problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe combination of an intercept and a (possible negative) slope for sigma \\(\\sigma\\) technically allows for negative variance values, which is impossible (distributions cannot have a negative variance). This issue is one of the most important to address when setting up complex models for RTs.\n\n\nIndeed, even if we set a very narrow prior on the intercept of sigma \\(\\sigma\\) to fix it at for instance 0.14, and a narrow prior on the effect of condition, say \\(Normal(0, 0.001)\\), an effect of condition of -0.15 is still possible (albeit with very low probability). And such effect would lead to a sigma \\(\\sigma\\) of 0.14 - 0.15 = -0.01, which would lead to an error (and this will often happen as the sampling process does explore unlikely regions of the parameter space).\n\n4.3.1 Solution 1: Directional Effect of Condition\nOne possible (but not recommended) solution is to simply make it impossible for the effect of condition to be negative by Truncating the prior to a lower bound of 0. This can work in our case, because we know that the comparison condition is likely to have a higher variance than the reference condition (the intercept) - and if it wasn’t the case, we could have changed the reference factor. However, this is not a good practice as we are enforcing a very strong a priori specific direction of the effect, which is not always justified.\n\n@model function model_ScaledlGaussian(rt; condition=nothing)\n\n    # Priors\n    μ_intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 1); lower=0)\n    μ_condition ~ Normal(0, 0.3)\n\n    σ_intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 0.5); lower=0)  # Same prior as previously\n    σ_condition ~ truncated(Normal(0, 0.1); lower=0)  # Enforce positivity\n\n    for i in 1:length(rt)\n        μ = μ_intercept + μ_condition * condition[i]\n        σ = σ_intercept + σ_condition * condition[i]\n        rt[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n    end\nend\n\nfit_ScaledlGaussian = model_ScaledlGaussian(df.RT; condition=df.Accuracy)\nchain_ScaledGaussian = sample(fit_ScaledlGaussian, NUTS(), 400)\n\n\n# Summary (95% CI)\nhpd(chain_ScaledGaussian; alpha=0.05)\n\n\nHPD\n   parameters     lower     upper \n       Symbol   Float64   Float64 \n  μ_intercept    0.5081    0.5148\n  μ_condition    0.1330    0.1446\n  σ_intercept    0.1219    0.1271\n  σ_condition    0.0714    0.0810\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the effect of condition on sigma \\(\\sigma\\) is significantly positive: the variance is higher in the Accuracy condition as compared to the Speed condition.\n\n\n4.3.2 Solution 2: Avoid Exploring Negative Variance Values\nThe other trick is to force the sampling algorithm to avoid exploring negative variance values (when sigma \\(\\sigma\\) &lt; 0). This can be done by adding a conditional statement when sigma \\(\\sigma\\) is negative to avoid trying this value and erroring, and instead returning an infinitely low model probability (-Inf) to push away the exploration of this impossible region.\n\n@model function model_ScaledlGaussian(rt; condition=nothing)\n\n    # Priors\n    μ_intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 1); lower=0)\n    μ_condition ~ Normal(0, 0.3)\n\n    σ_intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 0.5); lower=0)\n    σ_condition ~ Normal(0, 0.1)\n\n    for i in 1:length(rt)\n        μ = μ_intercept + μ_condition * condition[i]\n        σ = σ_intercept + σ_condition * condition[i]\n        if σ &lt; 0  # Avoid negative variance values\n            Turing.@addlogprob! -Inf\n            return nothing\n        end\n        rt[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n    end\nend\n\nfit_ScaledlGaussian = model_ScaledlGaussian(df.RT; condition=df.Accuracy)\nchain_ScaledGaussian = sample(fit_ScaledlGaussian, NUTS(), 400)\n\n\nhpd(chain_ScaledGaussian; alpha=0.05)\n\n\nHPD\n   parameters     lower     upper \n       Symbol   Float64   Float64 \n  μ_intercept    0.5076    0.5148\n  μ_condition    0.1316    0.1444\n  σ_intercept    0.1223    0.1273\n  σ_condition    0.0709    0.0803\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npred = predict(model_ScaledlGaussian([(missing) for i in 1:length(df.RT)], condition=df.Accuracy), chain_ScaledGaussian)\npred = Array(pred)\n\nfig = plot_distribution(df, \"Predictions made by Scaled Gaussian Model\")\nfor i in 1:length(chain_ScaledGaussian)\n    lines!(Makie.KernelDensity.kde(pred[:, i]), color=ifelse(df.Accuracy[i] == 1, \"#388E3C\", \"#D32F2F\"), alpha=0.1)\nend\nfig\n\n\n┌ Warning: Found `resolution` in the theme when creating a `Scene`.

    "text": "4.4 The Problem with Linear Models\nReaction time (RTs) have been traditionally modeled using traditional linear models and their derived statistical tests such as t-test and ANOVAs. Importantly, linear models - by definition - will try to predict the mean of the outcome variable by estimating the “best fitting” Normal distribution. In the context of reaction times (RTs), this is not ideal, as RTs typically exhibit a non-normal distribution, skewed towards the left with a long tail towards the right. This means that the parameters of a Normal distribution (mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\)) are not good descriptors of the data.\n\n\nLinear models try to find the best fitting Normal distribution for the data. However, for reaction times, even the best fitting Normal distribution (in red) does not capture well the actual data (in grey).\n\nA popular mitigation method to account for the non-normality of RTs is to transform the data, using for instance the popular log-transform. However, this practice should be avoided as it leads to various issues, including loss of power and distorted results interpretation (Lo and Andrews 2015; Schramm and Rouder 2019). Instead, rather than applying arbitrary data transformation, it would be better to swap the Normal distribution used by the model for a more appropriate one that can better capture the characteristics of a RT distribution.",

    "text": "4.5 Shifted LogNormal Model\nOne of the obvious candidate alternative to the log-transformation would be to use a model with a Log-transformed Normal distribution. A LogNormal distribution is a distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. In this model, the mean \\(\\mu\\) and is defined on the log-scale, and effects must be interpreted as multiplicative rather than additive (the condition increases the mean RT by a factor of \\(\\exp(\\mu_{condition})\\)).\nNote that for LogNormal distributions (as it is the case for many of the models introduced in the rest of the capter), the distribution parameters (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)) are not independent with respect to the mean and the standard deviation (SD). The empirical SD increases when the mean \\(\\mu\\) increases (which is seen as a feature rather than a bug, as it is consistent with typical reaction time data (Wagenmakers, Grasman, and Molenaar 2005)).\nA Shifted LogNormal model introduces a shift (a delay) parameter tau \\(\\tau\\) that corresponds to the minimum “starting time” of the response process.\nWe need to set a prior for this parameter, which is usually truncated between 0 (to exclude negative minimum times) and the minimum RT of the data (the logic being that the minimum delay for response must be lower than the faster response actually observed).\nWhile \\(Uniform(0, min(RT))\\) is a common choice of prior, it is not ideal as it implies that all values between 0 and the minimum RT are equally likely, which is not the case. Indeed, psychology research has shown that such minimum response time for Humans is often betwen 100 and 250 ms. Moreover, in our case, we explicitly removed all RTs below 180 ms, suggesting that the minimum response time is more likely to approach 180 ms than 0 ms.\n\n4.5.1 Prior on Minimum RT\nInstead of a \\(Uniform\\) prior, we will use a \\(Gamma(1.1, 11)\\) distribution (truncated at min.

    "text": "4.6 ExGaussian Model\nAnother popular model to describe RTs uses the ExGaussian distribution, i.e., the Exponentially-modified Gaussian distribution (Balota and Yap 2011; Matzke and Wagenmakers 2009).\nThis distribution is a convolution of normal and exponential distributions and has three parameters, namely mu \\(\\mu\\) and sigma \\(\\sigma\\) - the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution - and tau \\(\\tau\\) - the exponential component of the distribution (note that although denoted by the same letter, it does not correspond directly to a shift of the distribution). Intuitively, these parameters reflect the centrality, the width and the tail dominance, respectively.\n\nBeyond the descriptive value of these types of models, some have tried to interpret their parameters in terms of cognitive mechanisms, arguing for instance that changes in the Gaussian components (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)) reflect changes in attentional processes [e.g., “the time required for organization and execution of the motor response”; Hohle (1965)], whereas changes in the exponential component (\\(\\tau\\)) reflect changes in intentional (i.e., decision-related) processes (Kieffaber et al. 2006). However, Matzke and Wagenmakers (2009) demonstrate that there is likely no direct correspondence between ex-Gaussian parameters and cognitive mechanisms, and underline their value primarily as descriptive tools, rather than models of cognition per se.\nDescriptively, the three parameters can be interpreted as:\n\nMu \\(\\mu\\) : The location / centrality of the RTs. Would correspond to the mean in a symmetrical distribution.\nSigma \\(\\sigma\\) : The variability and dispersion of the RTs. Akin to the standard deviation in normal distributions.\nTau \\(\\tau\\) : Tail weight / skewness of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that these parameters are not independent with respect to distribution characteristics, such as the empirical mean and SD.

Although only the tail weight parameter (tau \\(\\tau\\)) is changed, the whole distribution appears to shift is centre of mass.

While we will unpack this definition below and emphasize its important consequences, one can first note that it has been described as a potential model for RTs when convoluted with an exponential distribution (in the same way that the ExGaussian distribution is a convolution of a Gaussian and an exponential distribution). However, this Ex-Wald model (Schwarz 2001) was shown to be less appropriate than one of its variant, the Shifted Wald distribution (Heathcote 2004; Anders et al. 2016).\nNote that the Wald distribution, similarly to the models that we will be covering next (the “generative” models), is different from the previous distributions in that it is not characterized by a “location” and “scale” parameters (mu \\(\\mu\\) and sigma \\(\\sigma\\)). Instead, the parameters of the Shifted Wald distribution are:\n\nNu \\(\\nu\\) : A drift parameter, corresponding to the strength of the evidence accumulation process.\nAlpha \\(\\alpha\\) : A threshold parameter, corresponding to the amount of evidence required to make a decision.\nTau \\(\\tau\\) : A delay parameter, corresponding to the non-response time (i.e., the minimum time required to process the stimulus and respond).

    "text": "5.1 Evidence Accumulation\nIn the previous chapter, we introduced the Wald distribution and its parameters, nu \\(\\nu\\) (drift rate) and alpha \\(\\alpha\\) (threshold). This distribution appears to have been first derived in 1900 to model the time a stock reaches a certain price (a threshold price) for the first time, and used in 1915 by Schrödinger as the time to first passage of a threshold of a Brownian motion (i.e., a random walk).\nA random walk describes a path consisting of a succession of random steps. It has been used by Francis Galton in 1894 to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem, and is now known as the Galton Board. The Galton Board is a physical model of a random walk, where balls are dropped from the top and bounce left or right at each peg until they reach the bottom. The distribution of the final position of the balls is a normal distribution.\nIn the figure below, we can see a computer simulation illustrating the same concept, with “time” being displayed on the x-axis. All iterations start at y=0, and change by -1 or +1 at each time step, until it reaches a threshold of t = 0.7 seconds.\nRandom walks are used to model a wide range of phenomena, such as the movement of particules and molecules, the stock market, the behavior of animals and, crucially, cognitive processes. For instance, it can be used to approximate evidence accumulation: the idea that a decision maker (be it a Human or any other system) accumulates evidence in a “stochastic” (i.e., random) fashion over time until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made.",

    "section": "5.2 Wald Distribution (Revisited)",
    "text": "5.2 Wald Distribution (Revisited)\nThis is how the Wald distribution is actually generated. It corresponds to the distribution of times that it takes for a stochastic process to reach a certain threshold \\(\\alpha\\) (a certain amount of “evidence”). The twist is that the process underlying this model is a random walk with a drift rate \\(\\nu\\), which corresponds to the average amount of evidence accumulated per unit of time. In other words, the drift rate \\(\\nu\\) is the “slope” of the evidence accumulation process, representing the strength of the evidence (or the speed by which the decision maker accumulates evidence). The threshold \\(\\alpha\\) is the amount of evidence required to reach a decision (“decision” typically meaning making a response).\n\n\nIn this figure, the red line at 0 represents the non-decision time tau \\(\\tau\\). The dotted red line corresponds to the threshold \\(\\alpha\\), and the drift rate \\(\\nu\\) is the slope of the black line. The time at which each individual random accumulator crosses the threshold forms a Wald distribution.\n\nAs you can see, the Wald distribution belongs to a family of models thata do not merely attempt at describing the empirical distributions by tweaking and convolving distributions (like the ExGaussian or LogNormal models). Instead, their parameters are characterizing the data generation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile such “generative” models offer potential insights into the cognitive processes underlying the data, they inherently make strong assumptions about said underlying process (for instance, that the data of a task can be approximated by a stochastic evidence accumulation process). It is thus crucial to always keep in mind the limitations and assumptions of the models we use. Don’t forget, with great power comes great responsability.",

    "section": "5.3 Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)",
    "text": "5.3 Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)\nInterestingly, the Wald model is actually a special case of a more general type called the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) (named as such because the evidence accumulation is assumed to be a “diffusion” process, i.e., a random walk). One of the main difference is that in the Wald model, the drift rate \\(\\nu\\) must be positive, as it tracks the time taken by the diffusion processes to reach only one “positive” threshold \\(\\alpha\\).\nBut what happens if we relax this and allow the drift rate to be null or negative? Many traces might never reach the upper threshold, and might instead reach high “negative” values.\nDrift Diffusion Models are useful to jointly model RTs and a binary outcome, such as 2 different choices or accuracy (i.e., “correct” vs. “error”).\n\nThe parameters are:\n\nNu \\(\\nu\\) : The drift rate (also sometimes denoted delta \\(\\delta\\)), representing the average slope of the accumulation process towards the boundaries. The larger the (absolute value of the) drift rate, the more effective the evidence accumulation for the corresponding response option. A drift rate close to 0 suggests an ambiguous stimulus. Typical range: [-5, 5].\nAlpha \\(\\alpha\\) : The boundary separation threshold is the distance between the two decision bounds (lower bound being at 0 and upper bound at alpha \\(\\alpha\\)). It has been interpreted as a measure of response caution (i.e., of speed-accuracy trade-off, with high alpha \\(\\alpha\\) being related to high accuracy). It represents the amount of evidence that is needed to make a response. Typical range: [0.5, 2].\nBeta \\(\\beta\\) : The initial bias towards any of the responses. The starting point of the accumulation process (in percentage of alpha \\(\\alpha\\): if \\(\\alpha = 2.0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0.5\\), then the actual starting point is \\(2.0*0.5=1\\)). Typical range: [0.3, 0.7].\nTau \\(\\tau\\) : The non-decision time. It represents all non-decisional process, such as stimulus encoding, motor processes, etc. Typical range (in seconds): [0.1, 0.5].\n\nThis basic model is sometimes referred to as a Wiener model, as expanded versions of the DDM exist with additional parameters (e.g., variability of the drift rate).",
