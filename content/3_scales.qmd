# Choices and Scales

In many situations, the dependent variable is not continuous, nor is it even normally distributed.

## Bounded Variables

While might be tempted to believe that most variables in psychological science are true **continuous** variables, this is often not the case. 
In fact, many variables are **bounded**: there values are delimited by hard bounds. 
This is typically the case for slider (aka "analog" scakes), dimensions scores (average or sum) from multiple Likert scales, percentages, proportions, etc.

Most psychometric indices are bounded. 
For instance, the minimum and maximum values for the IQ test (WAIS-IV) are 45-155. It is 0 and 63 for the depression scale BDI-II, 20 and 80 for the STAI.

Despite this fact, we still most often use **linear models** to analyze these data, which is not ideal as it assumes that the dependent variable is continuous and normally distributed.

### The Problem with Linear Models



### Rescaling

```{julia}
#| code-fold: false


```

### Beta Models

```{julia}
#| code-fold: false

using Distributions, Random
using Turing

# Reparameterized Beta distribution
function BetaMean(μ, σ)
    if σ <= 0 || σ >= sqrt(μ * (1 - μ))
        error("Standard deviation σ must be in the interval (0, sqrt(μ*(1-μ))=$(sqrt(μ*(1-μ)))).")
    end
    ν = μ * (1 - μ) / σ^2 - 1
    α = μ * ν
    β = (1 - μ) * ν

    return Beta(α, β)
end
```

```{julia}
#| eval: false

@model function model_Beta(x)
    μ ~ Beta(1, 1)
    σ ~ Uniform(eps(typeof(μ)), μ * (1 - μ) - eps(typeof(μ)))
    for i in 1:length(x)
        x[i] ~ MeanVarBeta(μ, σ)
    end
end
chains = sample(model_Beta(rand(MeanVarBeta(0.5, 0.2), 200)), NUTS(), 500; 
   initial_params=[0.5, 0.1])
```
