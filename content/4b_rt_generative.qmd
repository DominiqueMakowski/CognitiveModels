# Generative Models

## Evidence Accumulation

This distribution appears to have been first derived in 1900 to model the time a stock reaches a certain price (a *threshold* price) for the first time, and used in 1915 by Schr√∂dinger as the time to first passage of a threshold of a Brownian motion (i.e., a random walk).

Move from statistical models that *describe* to models that *generate* RT-like data.

## Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)

Use DDM as a case study to introduce generative models

## Other Models (LBA, LNR)

## Including Random Effects

TODO.
