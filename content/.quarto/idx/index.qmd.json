{"title":"Preface","markdown":{"headingText":"Preface","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## Why Julia?\n\n[**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) - the new cool kid on the scientific block - is a modern programming language with many benefits when compared with R or Python.\nImportantly, it is currently the only language in which we can fit all the cognitive models under a Bayesian framework using a unified interface like [**Turing**](https://turing.ml/) and [**SSM**](https://github.com/itsdfish/SequentialSamplingModels.jl).\n\n## Why Bayesian?\n\nUnfortunately, cognitive models often involve distributions for which Frequentist estimations are not yet implemented, and usually contain a lot of parameters (due to the presence of **random effects**), which makes traditional algorithms fail to converge.\nSimply put, the Bayesian approach is the only one currently robust enough to fit these somewhat complex models.\n\n## The Plan\n\nAs this is a fast-evolving field (both from the theoretical - with new models being proposed - and the technical side - with improvements to the packages and the algorithms), the book needs to be future-resilient and updatable to keep up with the latest best practices. \n\n- [ ] Decide on the framework to build the book in a reproducible and collaborative manner (Quarto?)\n- [ ] Set up the infrastructure to automatically build it using GitHub actions and host it on GitHub pages\n- [ ] Write the content of the book\n- [ ] Referencing\n  - Add Zenodo DOI and reference (but how to deal with evolving author? Through versioning?)\n  - Publish a paper to present the book project ([JOSE](https://jose.theoj.org/))?\n\n\n## Looking for Coauthors\n\nThis project can only be achieved by a team, and I suspect no single person has currently all the skills and knowledge to cover all the content. We need many people who have strengths in various aspects, such as Julia/Turing, theory, writing, making plots etc.\nMost importantly, this project can serve as a way for us to learn more about this approach to psychological science. \n\n**If you are *interested* in the project, you can let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/CognitiveModels/issues) or getting in touch.**","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"execute":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
