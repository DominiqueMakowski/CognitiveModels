        "Reaction time (RTs) have been traditionally modeled using traditional linear models and their derived statistical tests such as *t*-test and ANOVAs. Importantly, linear models - by definition - will try to predict the *mean* of the outcome variable by estimating the \"best fitting\" *Normal* distribution. In the context of reaction times (RTs), this is not ideal, as RTs typically exhibit a non-normal distribution, skewed towards the left with a long tail towards the right. This means that the parameters of a Normal distribution (mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$) are not good descriptors of the data.\n",
