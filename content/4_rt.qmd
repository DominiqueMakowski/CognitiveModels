## Descriptive Models (ExGaussian, LogNormal, Wald)

### Modelling RT with a Bayesian Linear Model

#### The Data

```{julia}
using Downloads, CSV, DataFrames
using Turing, Distributions
using CairoMakie

df = CSV.read(Downloads.download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealityBending/DoggoNogo/main/study1/data/data_game.csv"), DataFrame)
first(df, 10)
```


#### The Model

```{julia}
#| code-fold: false

@model function model_linear(rt; isi=nothing)

    # Set priors on variance, intercept and effect of ISI
    σ² ~ truncated(Normal(0, 1); lower=0)
    intercept ~ truncated(Normal(0, 1); lower=0)
    slope_isi ~ Normal(0, 0.5)

    for i in 1:length(rt)
        μ = intercept + slope_isi * isi[i]
        rt[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ²)
    end
end

model = model_linear(df.RT, isi=df.ISI)
chain_linear = sample(model, NUTS(), 200)

# Summary (95% CI)
quantile(chain_linear; q=[0.025, 0.975])
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Code Tip"}
We first initialize the model by passing the `RT` and `ISI` columns.

#### Posterior Predictive Check

```{julia}
#| output: false

pred = predict(model_linear([(missing) for i in 1:length(df.RT)]; isi=df.ISI), chain_linear)
pred = Array(pred)
```

```{julia}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 7

f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1], title="Predicted Data by Linear Model",
    xlabel="RT (s)",
    ylabel="Distribution",
    yticksvisible=false,
    xticksvisible=false,
    yticklabelsvisible=false)

CairoMakie.density!(df.RT, color="grey")
for i in 1:length(chain_linear)
    lines!(ax, Makie.KernelDensity.kde(pred[:, i]), color="orange", alpha=0.1)
end
CairoMakie.ylims!(ax, (0, nothing))
f
```

### The Problem with Linear Models

Reaction time (RTs) have been traditionally modeled using traditional linear models and their derived statistical tests such as *t*-test and ANOVAs. Importantly, linear models - by definition - will try to predict the *mean* of the outcome variable by estimating the "best fitting" *Normal* distribution. In the context of reaction times (RTs), this is not ideal, as RTs typically exhibit a non-normal distribution, skewed towards the left with a long tail towards the right. This means that the parameters of a Normal distribution (mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$) are not good descriptors of the data.

> Linear models try to find the best fitting Normal distribution for the data. However, for reaction times, even the best fitting Normal distribution (in red) does not capture well the actual data (in grey).

A popular mitigation method to account for the non-normality of RTs is to transform the data, using for instance the popular *log-transform*. 
However, this practice should be avoided as it leads to various issues, including loss of power and distorted results interpretation [@lo2015transform; @schramm2019reaction].
Instead, rather than applying arbitrary data transformation, it would be better to swap the Normal distribution used by the model for a more appropriate one that can better capture the characteristics of a RT distribution.


### Shifted LogNormal Models

One of the obvious candidate alternative to the log-transformation would be to use a model with a Log-transformed Normal distribution.


### Wald

Moe from statistical models that *describe* to models that *generate* RT-like data.

### Generative Models (DDM)

Use DDM as a case study to introduce generative models

### Other Models (LBA, LNR)
