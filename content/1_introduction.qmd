# Pieces of Puzzle

1. Very quick intro to Julia and Turing
2. Linear Regression: understand what the parameters mean (intercept, slopes, sigma)
3. Boostrapping: Introduce concepts related to pseudo-posterior distribution description
4. Hierarchical Models: Simpson's paradox, random effects, how to leverage them to model interindividual differences
5. Bayesian estimation: introduce Bayesian estimation and priors over parameters
6. Bayesian mixed linear regression: put everything together
